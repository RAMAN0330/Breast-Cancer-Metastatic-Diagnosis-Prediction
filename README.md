## Overview

In this project, I aim to predict the metastatic diagnosis period for breast cancer patients using a dataset of approximately 19k records. The dataset includes various patient characteristics such as age, race, BMI, and zip code, along with diagnosis and treatment information, geo-demographic data, and climate data.

## Dataset Description

The dataset comprises two main files:
- **train.csv**: This training dataset contains observed values of the metastatic diagnosis period for each patient.
- **test.csv**: The test dataset withholds the observed diagnosis period values for prediction.

### Features

The dataset includes several features such as:
- Patient demographics (e.g., age, race, gender)
- Diagnosis and treatment information (e.g., diagnosis codes, treatments)
- Geo-demographic data (e.g., income, education, rent)
- Climate data

## Objective

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model to forecast the metastatic diagnosis period for each patient in the test dataset using the provided features.

## Methodology

To accomplish this task, I will follow these steps:
1. **Data Exploration**: Explore the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Address any missing or inconsistent data and perform necessary preprocessing steps.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Extract relevant features and transform the data as needed.
4. **Model Building**: Develop predictive models using machine learning algorithms.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.
6. **Prediction**: Generate predictions for the test dataset and assess the model's accuracy.

## Conclusion

By successfully predicting the metastatic diagnosis period, this project aims to contribute to the understanding and management of breast cancer. I look forward to sharing the insights gained from this analysis and the potential implications for patient care.
